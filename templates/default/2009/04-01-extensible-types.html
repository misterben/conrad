Finally I've got idea how to properly implement extensible types of pages. In
short: dynamic subclassing of predefined classes. This will allow to add any
other type in future without a hassle.

Nice thing is that I don't need to be overly concerned of performance, as it's
just one-time generation of static pages. ;-)
